### Day 3

Eh, kind of sucks I think. But it works! And so far every time I actually run the code to get the final output, it's the right answer, first try! So it can't be all bad.

### Day 2

Can't decide if I went too far today, might could have simplified. I actually started in one direction that sucked, but did get me the right answer in the first half. I scrapped that and started over to do the second half. This is a cautionary tale about setting up good data structures from the start.

### Day 1

I haven't done AoC in a while. Time to brush up and do this thing in Typescript. No tricks, no hacks, just do the puzzles and publish them here.
