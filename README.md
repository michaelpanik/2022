### Day 6

Well I was feeling pretty good about my sub-20-minute time today, until I looked the leaderboards. I was right aroun 10 THOUSANDTH place. Rank 10798. Unreal. You nerds need something better to do with your time, idk.

But I digress.

Still nailed the problems and feeling good about it. I'll shoot for a better rank tommorrow night.

### Day 5

A little embarassing, but I only today learned of the timed nature of the AoC challenge. I'm going to go for fast submission tonight. In order to help with that, I created a basic jest test, and I wrote a bash script to scaffold out the files for me. I could take it a step further and hit the page the second a new challenge is available, get the info, bring it in, etc., but that may be excessive.

Today was really hard, took a lot of time just parsing out the input properly. I also forget about the JS `.reverse()` function for arrays, and was trying to sort instead of reverse. What a pain.

Once again I set things up in a way where challenge 2 took only a very minor change and I nailed in on the first try. That's encouraging - I'm architecting solutions well, even if not cleverly.

### Day 4

Well I just had to run my mouth. First day where I input an incorrect answer at first. BUT the solution to the second half was changing to function calls, `Array.every` to `Array.some`. JS Arrays are kind of magical, for all the language's flaws, and it really shines in moments like this.

### Day 3

Eh, kind of sucks I think. But it works! And so far every time I actually run the code to get the final output, it's the right answer, first try! So it can't be all bad.

### Day 2

Can't decide if I went too far today, might could have simplified. I actually started in one direction that sucked, but did get me the right answer in the first half. I scrapped that and started over to do the second half. This is a cautionary tale about setting up good data structures from the start.

### Day 1

I haven't done AoC in a while. Time to brush up and do this thing in Typescript. No tricks, no hacks, just do the puzzles and publish them here.
